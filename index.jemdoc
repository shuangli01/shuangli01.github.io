=== About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en School of Data Science] at
[https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)]. Previously, I was a
postdoctoral fellow at [https://www.harvard.edu/ Harvard University], working on mobile health with
Prof. [https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/ Susan Murphy]. I earned my Ph.D. in Industrial
Engineering from the [https://isye.gatech.edu H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering] at
[https://www.gatech.edu/ Georgia Tech] in 2019, and earlier, I received B.E. in Automation from the
[https://en.ustc.edu.cn/ University of Science and Technology of China] in 2011.

~~~
{}
I’m recruiting Research Assistants year-round and have 1–2 PhD openings starting Fall 2026.
If you are interested in working with me and have good programming skills and math background,
you can contact me via email with your CV.

=== Research Interests

My research delves into the development of knowledge-enhanced sequential models and sequential decision tools, which prioritize interpretability and trustworthiness in machine learning.
More specifically, my research focuses on:

- Knowledge-Enhanced Sequential Models: By integrating domain-specific knowledge into
  machine learning algorithms, we aim to facilitate transparent decision-making processes and
  to create robust and reliable frameworks applicable in high-stakes systems.
- Human Cognitive Process Modeling: By incorporating Theory of Mind and spatial-temporal
  logical reasoning into AI systems, we aim to enable effective collaboration between humans and AI.
- Applications in Healthcare: We aim to apply machine learning tools to improve healthcare
  policies, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes through informed decision-making.
